## What I think you should do in the following order

1.  redo the fellowship in jQuery
2.  Read the chapter of eloquent javascript on HTTP. (don't have to understand, but its important you have some more knowledge about it, youtube video works too)
3.  Use an Api (Seattle Data, White House Gov, OMDB, pokemon, soundclound),
and render the data on the screen and style the page and make it look nice, 
and if you like it, keep building it out.
4. Start building a game, treat it like a project week, so do nothing but build a game 
all week long. (this will really help with your javascript skills)
a. Ideas (memory, guessing game using an api, Canvas game(using p5, or phaser), asteroids)
5. Try out another API and build something with it.
6. Learn Bootstrap (youtube, treehouse, have good lessons for this)
7. Bootstrap one of your API projects or start a new one, and make it responsive(so it looks good on a phone, ipad, or computer)(media queries may help with this)


### this is alot of stuff but if you do this, you will be in a really solid, position on the front end


### Bonus Web audio and Canvas are fun, (you can create a visulizer, mdn has a tutorial)

### Youtube dudes/dudettes
1. The Coding Train - p5
2. DesignCourse
3. thenewboston - everything lots of front end
4. quinten Watt tutorials - bootstrap, frontend stuff
5. curran kelleher - anything data visualizion (graphs, d3, angular)



### Above all READ THE DOCS and use stack Overflow regiously
